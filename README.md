## About

The TCGPlayer App is cool, but it doesn't allow you to link to any collection manager. This script converts the emailed .txt file generated by the app into a .csv file that mimics an MTG Studio file.

## Usage

Save the list of cards generated by the app as a .txt into the same directory as the script, then execute

```
Python TCGtoGoldfish.py <input.txt>
```

The .csv will be saved in the same directory.
